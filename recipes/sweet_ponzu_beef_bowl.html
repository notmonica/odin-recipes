        <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse until
                water runs clear. Add to a small pot with 1 cup
                water (2 cups for 4 servings) and a pinch of
                salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce
                to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15
                minutes. Keep covered off heat for at least 10
                minutes or until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Peel
                and finely chop garlic. Zest and quarter lime
                (for 4 servings, zest 1 lime and quarter both).
                Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly
                slice crosswise into half-moons. Halve, peel,
                and dice onion. Trim, peel, and grate carrot.
                Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating
                whites from greens.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine cucumber, juice
                from half the lime, ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for
                4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Set aside
                to quick-pickle, stirring occasionally, until
                ready to serve. In a small bowl, combine
                mayonnaise, a pinch of garlic, a squeeze of
                lime juice, and as much wasabi as you’d like
                (start with a little, then taste and add more
                from there if desired). Season with salt and
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Once rice has cooked 15 minutes, heat a
                drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high
                heat. Add onion and scallion whites; cook,
                stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Add
                beef, remaining garlic, and 2 tsp sugar (4
                tsp for 4 servings). Cook, breaking up meat
                into pieces, until beef is browned and cooked
                through, 4-5 minutes. Stir in ponzu. Turn off
                heat; taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Fluff rice with a fork and stir in lime zest
                and 1 TBSP butter; season with salt. Divide
                between bowls. Arrange beef, grated carrot,
                and pickled cucumber (draining first) on top.
                Top with scallion greens and a squeeze of
                lime juice. Drizzle with wasabi mayo.</li>
